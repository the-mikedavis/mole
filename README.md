# Mole

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/the-mikedavis/mole.svg?token=h2ecsdphjZp1AedKhwAq&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/the-mikedavis/mole)

Mole is a game like Tinder but for skin moles. You can swipe left and right on
images of moles depending on whether you think it's a good idea to have it be
checked out or whether you think it's fine.

## Technologies

* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/): a dynamically typed functional language with great concurrency support and low latency. I use Elixir for all back-end logic.
* [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/): Rails is to Ruby as Phoenix is to Elixir. Phoenix makes it easy to write a web-app backend in Elixir.
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): An open-source and easy to use database. Postgres manages all long-term state like information on videos and accounts.
* [Slime](https://slime-lang.com/): Slim HTML with support for templating in Elixir. All pages are rendered using compiled Slime.
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html) (indented style): a suped-up CSS with minimal syntax. Sass handles all stylization.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): A build tool for front-end assets. Webpack automatically organizes and transpiles all front-end assets.
